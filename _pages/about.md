Currently, I'm a PhD student at [CopeNLU](https://www.copenlu.com/). My study will be advised by Prof. Isabelle Augenstein and Dr. Pepa Atanasova. Before joining CopeNLU, I worked as a junior researcher at KT AI2XL Lab., working on QA system. I obtained M.Sc in Computer Science and Engineering from Sungkyunkwan University under the supervision of Prof. Youngjoong Ko in Feb 2023. I'm interested in building and interpreting knowledge-enhanced language models that can solve real-world problems.
