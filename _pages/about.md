Currently, I'm a junior researcher at KT AI2XL Lab., working on QA system. I obtained M.Sc in Computer Science and Engineering from Sungkyunkwan University under the supervision of Prof. Youngjoong Ko in Feb 2023. I'm interested in building knowledge-enhanced language models that can solve real-world problems.
