Currently, I'm a PhD student at the [CopeNLU](https://www.copenlu.com/). My study will be advised by Prof. Isabelle Augenstein and Dr. Pepa Atanasova.

Before joining the CopeNLU in Sep 2023, I worked as a junior researcher at the KT AI2XL Lab., working on QA system. I obtained M.Sc in Computer Science and Engineering from Sungkyunkwan University under the supervision of Prof. Youngjoong Ko in Feb 2023.

I'm interested in building and interpreting knowledge-enhanced language models.
